    COMPLIANCE_VIOLATION = "compliance"   # Regulatory limit breaches
    
class AlertSeverity(Enum):
    LOW = "low"        # Information, minor deviations
    MEDIUM = "medium"  # Warning, attention required
    HIGH = "high"      # Critical, immediate action needed
    URGENT = "urgent"  # Emergency, system or major portfolio issues

def create_alert(alert_type: AlertType, severity: AlertSeverity, 
                message: str, portfolio_id: str) -> Alert
def process_alert_rules(portfolio_data: Dict, risk_limits: Dict) -> List[Alert]
