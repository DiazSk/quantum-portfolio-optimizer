## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Context
Based on the existing project structure, the compliance engine should integrate with:
- **API Layer**: `src/api/` - extend existing FastAPI endpoints
- **Portfolio Service**: `src/portfolio/` - integrate with optimization logic
- **Risk Service**: `src/risk/` - leverage existing risk calculation infrastructure
- **Database**: `src/database/` - extend existing PostgreSQL schema
- **Models**: `src/models/` - add compliance data models

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the epic - no previous story context available.

### Data Models
**Compliance Rules Schema** (extend existing PostgreSQL):
```sql
-- Compliance rule definitions
CREATE TABLE compliance_rules (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    rule_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'position_limit', 'mandate', 'concentration'
    rule_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    rule_config JSONB NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Compliance violations tracking
CREATE TABLE compliance_violations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    portfolio_id INTEGER,
    rule_id INTEGER REFERENCES compliance_rules(id),
    violation_details JSONB,
    severity VARCHAR(20), -- 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical'
    detected_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
