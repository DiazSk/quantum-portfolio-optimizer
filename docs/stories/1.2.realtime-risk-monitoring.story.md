## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Context
Building on existing risk infrastructure and extending current dashboard:
- **Risk Service**: `src/risk/risk_managment.py` - extend existing RiskManager class
- **Dashboard**: `src/dashboard/streamlit_dashboard.py` - add new risk monitoring components
- **API Layer**: `src/api/` - add new WebSocket endpoints for real-time data
- **Database**: `src/database/` - extend schema for alert configurations
- **Utilities**: `src/utils/professional_logging.py` - leverage existing risk event logging

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 (Regulatory Compliance Engine) completed successfully and established:
- Compliance validation infrastructure that can be leveraged for risk threshold checking
- Database schema patterns that should be followed for alert configurations
- API extension patterns that maintain backward compatibility
- Integration points with existing portfolio optimization workflow

### Data Models
**Alert Configuration Schema** (extend existing PostgreSQL):
```sql
-- Alert threshold configurations
CREATE TABLE risk_alert_thresholds (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    metric_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'var', 'cvar', 'drawdown', 'concentration', 'leverage'
    threshold_value DECIMAL(10,6) NOT NULL,
    severity_level VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical'
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Alert events and history
CREATE TABLE risk_alerts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    threshold_id INTEGER REFERENCES risk_alert_thresholds(id),
    portfolio_id INTEGER,
    metric_value DECIMAL(10,6),
    alert_status VARCHAR(20), -- 'triggered', 'acknowledged', 'resolved', 'escalated'
    triggered_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    acknowledged_at TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Notification delivery tracking
CREATE TABLE alert_notifications (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    alert_id INTEGER REFERENCES risk_alerts(id),
    notification_type VARCHAR(20), -- 'email', 'sms', 'dashboard'
    recipient VARCHAR(255),
    delivery_status VARCHAR(20), -- 'pending', 'sent', 'delivered', 'failed'
    sent_at TIMESTAMP,
    delivered_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test Framework**: pytest (existing project standard)
**Test Location**: `tests/risk/realtime_monitoring/`
**Coverage Requirement**: >90% unit test coverage
**Performance Testing**: WebSocket load testing with 100+ concurrent connections
**Integration Testing**: Required with existing risk calculation and dashboard systems

**Key Testing Scenarios**:
- Real-time risk metric calculation accuracy under load
- Alert threshold detection and notification delivery
- WebSocket connection stability and performance
- Dashboard real-time update reliability
- Escalation workflow timing and accuracy
- Integration with existing portfolio optimization workflow

**Special Testing Considerations**:
- Mock external notification services (email/SMS) for unit tests
