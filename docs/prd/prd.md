# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project**: Quantum Portfolio Optimizer\
**Type**: New Project Launch\
**Owner**: Product Manager (You)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Goals and Background Context

The Quantum Portfolio Optimizer aims to revolutionize investment
strategies by leveraging **quantum-inspired algorithms** and **machine
learning** for portfolio allocation, risk analysis, and alpha
generation.

-   **Background**: Traditional portfolio optimization (e.g., Modern
    Portfolio Theory, Black-Litterman) struggles with scale, non-linear
    constraints, and real-time adaptability.\
-   **Why Now**: With advances in quantum computing and scalable cloud
    infrastructure, it is now feasible to simulate complex financial
    scenarios and deliver near-instant optimization at scale.\
-   **Core Goal**: Provide institutional-grade portfolio optimization
    with **FAANG-level reliability, latency, and monitoring**, while
    remaining accessible via modern dashboards and APIs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Requirements

**Functional Requirements**\
1. **Portfolio Optimization Engine**\
- Support quantum-inspired algorithms (QAOA, VQE) alongside ML-driven
models.\
- Handle large-scale asset universes (1000+ assets).\
- Allow customizable constraints (sector caps, ESG filters, leverage
limits).

2.  **Data Ingestion & Processing**
    -   Integrate with market data APIs (Bloomberg, Alpha Vantage, Yahoo
        Finance).\
    -   Support real-time and batch data pipelines.\
    -   Store historical data for backtesting and retraining.
3.  **Task Orchestration & Scheduling**
    -   Distributed processing with Celery workers.\
    -   Support scheduled retraining of models and automated portfolio
        rebalancing.
4.  **User Interface**
    -   Streamlit dashboard with live portfolio KPIs (Sharpe ratio,
        alpha, volatility).\
    -   Support A/B testing of strategies.\
    -   Real-time performance visualization.
5.  **API Layer**
    -   REST + GraphQL endpoints for integration.\
    -   Secure access with OAuth2/JWT.\
    -   Latency target: \<200ms for optimization requests (P95).

**Non-Functional Requirements**\
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes across AWS, GCP,
Azure.\
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automated failover.\
- **Performance**: Sub-200ms latency under 1000+ concurrent users.\
- **Security**: Role-based access control, encrypted storage, and secure
APIs.\
- **Monitoring**: Full observability via Prometheus + Grafana.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

-   **Clarity & Accessibility**: Complex financial metrics displayed
    clearly; WCAG 2.1 compliance.\
-   **Interactivity**: Real-time dashboards, drill-down analysis,
    configurable visualizations.\
-   **Decision Support**: Scenario testing, A/B testing visualization,
    contextual recommendations.\
-   **Consistency**: Streamlit web app with responsive design;
    mobile-ready.\
-   **Delight Factor**: Smooth animations, dark/light mode, personalized
    dashboards.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Success Metrics
