# Final assessment - FAIL GATE DUE TO INCOMPLETE REMEDIATION
overall_assessment: "CRITICAL FAILURE - James's technical documentation claims are INACCURATE. Despite comprehensive remediation documentation, critical mock data remains in production files. Story 2.2 core implementation remains excellent, but system-wide issues persist and documentation reliability compromised."
