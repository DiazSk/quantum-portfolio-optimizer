# Brainstorming Document

## Topic Ideas

-   Quantum Portfolio Optimizer Extensions
-   FAANG-Level Data Analyst Portfolio Projects
-   Cloud Deployment Enhancements
-   AI/ML Model Integrations

## Structured Brainstorm

### Opportunities

1.  Integrate live financial data vendors (e.g., Bloomberg, Refinitiv).
2.  Expand optimization algorithms to GPU/TPU accelerators.
3.  Add real-time streaming with Kafka/Flink for tick data.
4.  Build investor-focused mobile dashboards with push notifications.

### Risks

-   Vendor lock-in with cloud services.
-   High compute costs for quantum simulations.
-   Data quality and freshness issues.
-   Complexity of multi-cloud orchestration.

### Next Steps

-   Prototype GPU acceleration for ML-based optimizers.
-   Research compliance requirements (SOC2/FINRA/SEC).
-   Explore multi-tenant cost metering and billing models.
-   Test user experience with mock investor personas.
